(Pre 2.0 versions included a [Vanilla Tweaks Resource Pack](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#FzZIiJ))

A modpack focused on what I think Minecraft should be, all of the best parts of Minecraft through-out it's history put together in one modpack, the sticks n' stones, the bread n' butter, the chicken n' waffles, whatever perfect combo you can think of, this is my take on that for Minecraft, with a few personal touches.
