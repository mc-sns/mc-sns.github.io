(Includes a [Vanilla Tweaks Resource Pack](https://vanillatweaks.net/share#FzZIiJ))

From Eyes of Ender being late game, to tool progression reworks, with some classic modpack tropes like more biomes thanks to [Biomes O' Plenty](https://modrinth.com/mod/biomes-o-plenty), and a slightly different early game thanks to [Divergent Progression](https://modrinth.com/mod/divergent-progression), this modpack is meant to be "the modpack of all time", my personal dream modpack.
