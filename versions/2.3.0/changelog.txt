## Important Changes

It's recommended you reinstall the modpack to make sure things work properly!


Make sure to backup your saves!

- Added default settings for Distant Horizons to be less performance heavy and to prevent lag on weaker systems.

- Disabling sleep is now a gamerule, enabled by default.

- Added [Enderscape](https://modrinth.com/mod/enderscape), which overhauls the End similar to the Nether update.

- Hotbar is similar to legacy console by default. (I would've made the change more subtle, but due to how Overflow Bars functions, I needed to do this instead.)

- Third person mode not changing back when respawning is now fixed.

- Mending is now usable in survival.

- Removed [Herobrine](https://modrinth.com/datapack/from-the-fog). (He was lagging the game, a lot!)
